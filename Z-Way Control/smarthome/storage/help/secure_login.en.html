<h3>I trust my local network</h3>
<p>
    Local WIFI connections are encrypted by the WIFI itself. To avoid further setup and installation work a connection on this local network will not be encrypted again. If you have doubts that your local network is save  - e.g. because somebody can tap into our cable or your WIFI network is not encrypted, please check this box. In this case we will only allow encrypted connections to your controller using a public redirection service with valid server keys. This may cause further delays.

<em>
  Note: Secure connections require valid server certificates. Since you gateway has been assigned to a dynamic local IP address we can’t validate the integrity to the local connection and possible encryption keys. Hence we don’t encrypt the data on the direct connection on your local network.
